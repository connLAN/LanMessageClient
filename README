How to compile LAN Messenger
============================

You need Qt (http://qt.nokia.com/) to compile.
I built LAN Messenger using Qt 4.7, so you probably 
need that or a later version. 

You also need OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/)
I used version 1.0.0.e, so you know the drill.

The application consists of two projects - lmc and lmcapp.
lmcapp is just an extension of the qtsingleapplication
project released by the Qt people. I have added a few
functions to support multilanguage UI.

The main project is lmc which contains the entire application.
I have included the project files for both projects.

Extract both folders. Make sure the dependency paths of lmc
are set to the correct locations. It depends on lmcapp and
openssl, in addition to the standard Qt libraries.

Note: This source is from the Linux version of the project.
The code is identical for all platforms, but there are a few
differences in the way application is built and run on each
platform. I will either give detailed steps or upload separate
source codes for different branches soon.
